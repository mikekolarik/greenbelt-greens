        <p><small><strong>Discounts.</strong> From time to time, to the extent legally permitted, we may offer free trials or one-time discounts on certain subscriptions for specified periods of time or for specified amounts. </small></p>
        <p><small>ONCE YOUR FREE TRIAL ENDS, OR AFTER THE INITIAL PERIOD FOR WHICH THE ONE-TIME DISCOUNT APPLIED, WE (OR OUR THIRD PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) WILL BEGIN BILLING YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR THE FULL COST OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUES, UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL OR PERIOD IN WHICH THE ONE-TIME DISCOUNT APPLIED.

        <p><small><strong>Referral Codes and Promotions.</strong> In connection with a promotion, we may offer you the ability to earn credits toward future purchases. Our promotion program may offer you the ability to invite your friends to open an account with Greenbelt Greens and to receive a credit when those friends place a Qualifying Order (defined below). On completion of a Qualifying Order, your account will be credited with a reward of ten dollars ($10.00 USD) or such other amount or promotional feature or reward as may be posted from time to time (the “Reward”). A “Qualifying Order” means the registration for, and completion of, at least 1 (one) full week of deliveries with Greenbelt Greens by an individual to whom you sent an invitation to join Greenbelt Greens, provided that such individual properly followed the instructions contained in the invite mechanism to connect their registration with your referral. A person who refers a friend to Greenbelt Greens is referred to in these Terms as a “Referrer”; a person who is referred to Greenbelt Greens is referred to as a “Referee.” In no event may a Referrer and Referee be the same individual or entity. At the conclusion of the Referee’s Qualifying Order, the Referrer’s account will be credited with the Reward.</small></p>
        <p><small>When a promotion code is redeemed, credit will be applied to a Referrer’s subsequent purchase until the Referrer’s credit balance reaches $0. If a purchase exceeds the Referrer’s credit amount, then the balance will be charged to a payment or debit card on file with the Referrer’s Greenbelt Greens account.</small></p>
        <p><small>Rewards may be redeemed only for the purchase of Products through the Sites and may not be used for the purchase of gift cards. Rewards are not transferable and may not be combined with Rewards belonging to others. At no time may you purchase, sell or barter any Rewards. Rewards have no cash value. They are promotional in nature and are issued without any exchange of money or value from you. As such, Rewards do not constitute property and you do not have a vested property right or interest in the Rewards. At our option, Rewards may expire 12 months after the date of issuance. We reserve the right at any time, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, to discontinue a promotion or to add or change the promotion rules, terms or conditions, including changing expiration periods or Rewards values for existing or future Rewards credits or replacing such Rewards with such other promotional rewards as we determine from time to time. If your account is terminated for any reason, any credit balances in your account may be cancelled, except as prohibited by law. Account balances are determined by Greenbelt Greens and such determination is final.</small></p>
        <p><small>We reserve the right to: (i) revoke any stated offer; (ii) correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omission; and (iii) make changes to prices, content, promotion offers, product descriptions or specifications, or other information without obligation to issue any notice of such changes (including after an order has been submitted, acknowledged, shipped, or received, except as prohibited by law). We also reserve the right to revise, suspend, or terminate a promotion at any time without notice (including after an order has been submitted and/or acknowledged).</small></p>
        <p><small>In addition to agreeing to other conditions set forth in these Terms, you must agree to the following in order to participate in any promotions offered by Greenbelt Greens: (a) To participate as a Referrer and to redeem the related Greenbelt Greens promotion, you must have a Greenbelt Greens account with valid payment or debit card on file, (b) to participate as a Referee and to redeem the related Greenbelt Greens promotion, you must create, for the first time, a Greenbelt Greens account with valid payment or debit card on file, (c) you will not create additional Greenbelt Greens accounts or use false names in order to send or receive a promotion. All participants are subject to these Terms.</small></p>
        <p><small>Greenbelt Greens reserves the right to close or suspend accounts, prohibit access to the Sites, revoke any and all referral credits, and/or demand alternative forms of payment if a code is fraudulently obtained or used or if we feel they were earned inappropriately, including if we suspect a user has breached these Terms or other policy documents and community guidelines incorporated herein, or if we are unable to verify or authenticate any of your personal information.</small></p>
        <h4>3.3. Payment and Billing Information</h4>
        <p><small>By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your Order. In the event you want to change or update payment information associated with your Greenbelt Greens account, you can do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@greenbeltgreens.com">support@greenbeltgreens.com.</a></small></p>
        <p><small>You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, changes to your Meal Subscription or changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and you authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.</small></p>
        <h4>3.4. Pricing and Availability </h4>
        <p><small>All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice; provided, however, that if we change the amounts or other charges associated with your Meal Subscription, we will provide advance notice of such changes in accordance with Section 2. The delivery of meals to you after our delivery of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless you cancel your subscription(s) in accordance with the cancellation policies set forth in Section 3.1.</small></p>
        <h4>3.5. Taxes</h4>
        <p><small>We will collect applicable sales tax on Products for which we determine we have a duty to collect sales tax. If an item is subject to sales tax, you agree that the amount of taxes shown at checkout may be adjusted. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates.</small></p>
        <h4>3.6. Deliveries </h4>
        <p><small>You agree to pay any delivery charges shown at the time you make a purchase. We reserve the right to increase, decrease, add or eliminate delivery charges from time to time, but we will provide notice of the charges applicable to you before you make your purchase. We will make our best effort to deliver your meals within your pre-selected delivery windows. If you are not present to receive delivery, we will leave your delivery at your door-step or where we determine to be the next best alternative. Upon completion of delivery, whether received by you or left for your receipt, you assume ownership and all risk of loss of Products. </small></p>
        <p><small>You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining the freshness of the Products you receive. To maintain the quality and integrity of the Products, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate all perishable Products upon delivery. From the time of delivery, the condition and consumption of the Products are solely at your risk, and you are solely responsible for the proper and safe handling, storage, use and consumption of the Products following delivery. </small></p>
        <p><small>If you are not able to receive delivery directly, we will generally leave the package for you at your door. If you are unable to collect your delivery within 1 hour of your specified delivery window, advance planning by you should be made for proper storage of your meal delivery prior to consumption. In certain areas, you may be able to provide additional delivery instructions when setting up your Greenbelt Greens account, such as requesting that your delivery be left with a doorman or neighbor. Any individual at the delivery address who accepts a delivery from us is presumed to be authorized to receive such delivery. In cases in which you have designated an alternative receiver, such person shall accept the delivery under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself.</small></p>
        <p><small>In the case of inclement weather or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur prior to the scheduled delivery date. In the event that timely delivery of your meals is not feasible, we will cancel your meal delivery for the period so affected and issue you a credit or refund of the purchase price for that meal delivery.</small></p>
        <h4>3.7. Container deposits and fees </h4>
        <p><small>Meals are delivered in reusable containers. These containers are the property of Greenbelt Greens and are lent to you during the course of your meal subscription. Containers will be collected as part of the meal delivery service by Greenbelt Greens. If any containers are unreturned for more than 14 days, you will be charged a fee of $1.50 per container for all containers that have not been returned in over 14 days.</small></p>
        <h4>3.8. No Resale </h4>
        <p><small>You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products for commercial purposes.</small></p>
        <h4>3.9. Returns and Refunds </h4>
        <p><small> If you are dissatisfied with a meal for any reason, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@greenbeltgreens.com">support@greenbeltgreens.com</a> within seven (7) days of the date you received the meal and we will either replace the meal at our expense or, depending on the circumstances, provide you a full or partial credit or refund of the purchase price for that meal. We may require the return or photographic documentation of any meal with which you are dissatisfied before we provide you a replacement, credit or refund.</small></p>

        <p><small>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.</small></p>
        <br><h3>11. Modifications to the Sites and Products</h3>
        <p><small>We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites (or any features or parts thereof) or the provision of the Products at any time and without liability therefor.</small></p>
        <br><h3>12. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration </h3>
        <p><small>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH GREENBELT GREENS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</small></p>
        <h4>12.1. Binding Arbitration </h4>
        <p><small>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Section 6 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Greenbelt Greens agree (a) to waive your and Greenbelt Green’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, or the Sites, Content or Products, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and Greenbelt Green’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Greenbelt Greens agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</small></p>
        <h4>12.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions </h4>
        <p><small>You and Greenbelt Greens agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Sites, Content or Products is personal to you and Greenbelt Greens and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and Greenbelt Greens agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Greenbelt Greens agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</small></p>
        <h4>12.3. Federal Arbitration Act </h4>
        <p><small>You and Greenbelt Greens agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 12 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</small></p>
        <h4>12.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution </h4>
        <p><small>You and Greenbelt Greens agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Greenbelt Greens shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Greenbelt Greens,Attn: General Counsel, 1524 S IH 35, Suite 310, Austin, TX 78704. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Greenbelt Greens account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically in accordance with Section 2 and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and Greenbelt Greens cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Greenbelt Greens may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 12, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 12.1, file a claim in court.</small></p>
        <h4>12.5. Process </h4>

You and Greenbelt Greens agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</small></p>
        <h4>12.6. Authority of Arbitrator </h4>
        <p><small>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.

        <h4>12.8. Severability </h4>
        <p><small>If any term, clause or provision of this Section 12 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 12 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 12.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</small></p>
        <h4>12.9. Opt-Out Right</h4>
        <p><small>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 12 by writing to: Greenbelt Greens, Attn: General Counsel, 1524 S IH 35, Suite 301, Austin, TX 78704.
